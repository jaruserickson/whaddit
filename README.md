# whaddit

let ai guess what a subreddit is about!

## Usage
To use whaddit, you'll need a few python libraries first (and an API key!)

```
pip3 install clarifai
pip3 install beautifulsoup4
pip3 install requests
```

After installing the 3 libraries above, you'll need an api key for clarifai since i can't afford to host on my own!

```
https://www.clarifai.com/
```

Then simply input your favourite subreddit and clarifai will guess what the subreddit is about, and try to predict its /r/ url!
