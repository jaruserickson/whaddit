# recommenddit

get recommendations on subreddits you may like based on a subreddit you like

## Usage
To use recommenddit, you'll need a few python libraries first (and an API key!)

```
pip3 install clarifai
pip3 install beautifulsoup4
pip3 install requests
```

After installing the 3 libraries above, you'll need an api key for clarifai since i can't afford to host on my own!
