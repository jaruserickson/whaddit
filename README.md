# reccomeddit

get reccomendations on subreddits you may like based on a subreddit you like

## Usage
To use reccomeddit, you'll need a few python packages first (and some API keys!)

```
pip3 install clarifai
pip3 install beautifulsoup4
pip3 install praw
```

After installing the 3 packages above, you'll need api keys for reddit and clarifai since i can't afford to host them on my own!
